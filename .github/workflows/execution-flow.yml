# Github action by default aborted the entire job if one step is failed.

# if:steps.run-ido-test.outcome
# steps - is a built in api for refrencing other steps in a job.
# outcome - is the result of the step (failure / success / cancelled / skipped)

# Special Conditional Functions:
# failure() - return true when any previous step / job failed
# success() - return true when every single step / job done successfully
# cancelled() - return true if the workflow has been canclled
# always() - return true always
